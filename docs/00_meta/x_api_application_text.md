# X API Application Text (English)

Use the following text when applying for the X Developer Platform or describing your App usage.

## 1. Core Use Case (Intended Use)

> **Question:** Describe how you plan to use Twitter data and/or API.

I am developing a technology news automation bot for my tech intelligence media website, "TechShift". The purpose of this bot is to automatically post updates about technology roadmaps and milestones (e.g., Space, AI, Green Tech) that are analyzed and published on my website.
This helps my audience (CTOs, PdMs, and tech investors) stay updated with the latest technological shifts and future predictions in real-time.
The system is read-only regarding Twitter content; it primarily uses the "Write" endpoint to post tweets. I do not plan to analyze Twitter data or track user metrics.

## 2. Specifics (Content & Interaction)

> **Question:** Will your app use Tweet, Retweet, Like, Follow, or Direct Message functionality?

Yes, the app will use the "Tweet" functionality.
When a new article is published or a technology roadmap is updated on my website (TechShift), the system will automatically generate a short summary (under 280 characters) with a link to the relevant page and post it to my X account.
For example: "🚨 Market Shift: Solid-State Battery mass production forecast moved to 2027 Q4. Read more: [Link]"
The posting frequency will be approximately 2-5 times per day.
The app will NOT perform any automated Retweeting, Liking, Following, or Direct Messaging. All interactions other than posting updates will be done manually by me using the standard Twitter client.

## 3. Display of Data

> **Question:** How will you display Tweets or Twitter content in your app?

My application is a backend script running on a server and does not have a user-facing frontend interface that displays Tweets.
It does not display Twitter content to any users. It only pushes content TO Twitter.

## 4. Government Entity

> **Question:** Will your product, service, or analysis make Twitter content or derived information available to a government entity?

No.
